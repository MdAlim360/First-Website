    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bangladesh</b> is a <small>small</small> and <emp>beautiful</emp> country in South Asia. We got independence in 1971 from Pakistan after a long war. Because of the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters we got this country. 16 December is our Victory Day because this day the Pakistani army surrendered.</p><br>

   <p> And 26th March is our Independence Day because in 1971’s 26th March Ziaur Rahman declared our independence from Chittagong. We are the only nation that sacrifices lives for language and now it is known as International Mother Language Day on 21st February. More than 180 countries celebrate this day.

      <h2 class="placement">Dhaka Metro Rail Paragraph</h2> 
    <center><img src="images/metrorail-dhaka-bangladesh-vector-illustration_551555-236.webp" height="100px" width="200px"></center>
      <p>Dhaka Metro Rail (DMR) is a rapid transit system under construction in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. A 20km Metro Rail route will be constructed from Uttara to Bangladesh Bank, having 16 stops. The 16 stations are Uttara, Mirpur, Rokeya Sarani, Khamarbari, Farmgate, Sonargaon Hotel, Shahbagh, Doel Chattar, and Topkhana Road. The Dhaka Metro Rail Project has a total cost of Tk 22,000 crore. The Japanese government, through JICA, will provide Tk 16,600 crores of the total project cost of Tk 22,000 crores ($2.5 billion) as a loan at a 0.01% interest rate. The rest will have to be managed by the government. The construction began in May 2015, and it is expected to be completed by 2022.</p> </br>
    
    <p> It is being built as an elevated concrete structure. All stations are being constructed as elevated concrete structures with massive pillars. It will not be a ground-level track like the ones you find in many cities worldwide, but rather a series of elevated tracks that run above the ground level. This is to keep these stations well away from traffic and pollution to ensure maximum comfort for passengers over long distances. The development of a metro rail project in Dhaka is speeding up in order to relieve the city’s severe traffic congestion. In two stages, the project will be completed. The metro rail service, officially known as the rapid mass transit (MRT) Line-6, is scheduled to transport around 60,000 people every hour once it is finished. It is expected to save travel time inside Dhaka city by a substantial amount. The initiative is estimated to save TK 200 billion every year, which will be a significant boon to our first-generation economy. However, Dhaka residents have been experiencing challenges as a result of significant traffic congestion since the project began. The continuous excavation for the metro train has resulted in this predicament </p></br>
    
    <p> Nonetheless, individuals are willing to put up with these little inconveniences because they know that eliminating traffic bottlenecks would save thousands of work hours. It would also provide a pleasant lifestyle for city people. As a result, it is fair to argue that metro rail has opened the door to a more contemporary and pleasant future. </p>

          <h2 class="placement2"> About Lionel Messi </h2> 
          <center><img src="images/messi2.jpg" height="100px" width="200px"></center>

         <p> Luis Lionel Andres Messi (“Lionel Messi”) is one of, if not, the most popular soccer player in the world. Born on June 24 1987, Messi was the youngest player ever to play for FC Barcelona. At the age of 16, Messi made his first appearance for FC Barcelona. Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina and moved to Spain at the age of 13 where he was offered the chance to train at FC Barcelona’s youth academy.  </p></br>

         <p>  At a young age, Messi was diagnosed with hormone deficiency which restricted his growth. Shorter than most of the kids at his age, Messi showed great talent and skills which put him in front of many organizations; one of which was Barcelona. Many organizations showed interest in him but due to his condition, little to no one wanted to pay for Messi’s medical treatment. However, Messi was given a trial with Barcelona where he impressed the coach. Barcelona offered Messi a contract which included Barcelona paying for Messi’s treatment in Spain. </p></br>
         <p> Messi progressed through the ranks and became the youngest player to score a league game. As the years went by, Messi kept improving and broke multiple records and set new standards.   </p> </br></br></br>
